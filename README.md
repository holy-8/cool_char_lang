Quick info
==========

Hello there! I am too lazy to document this thing properly. So here is some quick info.

Run the code in terminal with:
```
python /cool_char_lang/interpreter/main.py <filepath> [-args...]
```

If you're not too lazy, you can do the following:
1. Add `<your_path>/cool_char_lang/bat` to PATH environment variable.
2. Change `<your_path>` in the `.bat` (and in PATH variable) script to the **full path** to `cool_char_lang` folder.

You will be able to run the code like this:
```
CCL! <filepath> [-args...]
```

For the explanation of the language (very undetailed), look into `reference/` folder.

Sample programms can be found in `programms/` folder.

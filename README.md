# What's this?
I've decided to rewrite the interpreter from scratch, as there's a lot to be fixed and improved.
I also want to include some other things, such as unittests and better documentation.

Another idea i have is to make it easier to run, as well as multi-platform.


# Layout
For documentation, view (Doc/documentation.md)[https://github.com/holy-8/cool_char_lang/blob/2.0/Doc/documentation.md].
There are also two more files: `ascii.txt` contains the ASCII character table,
and `symbols.txt` is a list of instructions and their classes in code.

Example programs can be found in (Examples/)[https://github.com/holy-8/cool_char_lang/blob/2.0/Examples].
I will sort them out later, and more will be added.

(Interpreter/)[https://github.com/holy-8/cool_char_lang/blob/2.0/Interpreter] is the source code of the interpreter.
For now, i will be working on it, so its inner structure will change.


# C implementation
One of my friends also decided to make a C implementation of this language, called `3CL`.
You can find it (here)[https://github.com/nakidai/3cl].
Thanks!
